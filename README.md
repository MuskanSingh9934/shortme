## Shortme using Data Structures and Algorithms

# Project Title:

URL Shortener Service – A scalable link management system built with React, Node.js, and optimized using Hash Maps.

# Overview:

This project is a URL Shortener application that converts long, complex URLs into short, manageable links. The system is designed using Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) principles, particularly leveraging Hash Maps for efficient key-value pair storage and retrieval. The frontend is built with React, while the backend is powered by Node.js and Express.js, ensuring a fast and responsive user experience.

# Key Features:

✔ URL Shortening: Converts long URLs into short, shareable links
✔ Hash Map Optimization: Uses hashing techniques to generate unique short codes efficiently.
✔ Redirection Service: Seamlessly redirects users from the short URL to the original destination.
✔ User-Friendly Dashboard: Built with React, providing an intuitive interface for link management.

✔ Scalable Backend: Node.js server with efficient routing and database integration.

# Technologies Used:

Frontend: React.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Backend: Node.js, Express.js

Data Structures: Hash Maps (for key-value storage), Hashing Algorithms

Database: MongoDB
